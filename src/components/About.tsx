            I am a 24-year old software developer. I currently live in
            Wisconsin. I am a graduate from Thinkful, a coding boot camp, where
            I learned how to write programs with Javascript. I know a few other
            other languages and technologies, and have been learning more
            everyday.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I currently work as a Jr .NET Developer for Select Custom Solutions
            in La Crosse, WI.  
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Beyond coding, I am a hardworking, driven individual. I enjoy a
            challenge and love solving problems. I am a great team player and
            have a very positive outlook on difficult tasks, which makes work a
            lot more fun for me. I am looking for a position where I can work
            with experienced developers, to continue to grow my knowledge.
